## A/B Testing - Deciding the Effectiveness of Adding Screener in User Flow on Decreasing Early Course Cancellation

### Experiment Overview
Experiment is conducted by Udacity, a website focusing on online courses. The business goal is to maximizing course completion by their users/students. 

**Control - Before Treatment/Change**
- At time of the experiment, Udacity courses have two options on the course overview page: 'start free trial', and 'access course materials' 
- When student clicks 'start free trial', they will be asked to enter credit card information, and they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first.  
- If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

**Experiment - Description of the Treatment/Change**
- The change was that if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. 
- If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. 
- If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. 
- Student have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.
